# 1. <a id="project-overview">Project Overview</a>

A platform for creating agreements.  
The platform lets a group of people create a document that reflects the issues they agree upon  
and discuss the issues that are in disagreement.

The platform allows any group of people at any scale to formulate a text  
in a single, coherent and clear document in a transparent and democratic way.  
The platform enables it through a new kind of Internet discussion.  
Instead of spreading across countless responses,  
the discussion converges around a collaborative and democratic document  
by incorporating voting mechanisms with discussion tools.  
This allows distinguishment between agreed upon and controversial issues,  
and the process has a clear product: a text that reflects the consent of the participants.

## 2.2. Backend

- GraphQL API using Hasura in order to automate CRUD operations as much as possible.
- Secondary Graphql API for non-CRUD operations (e.g. for querying the cardano blockchain).
- The client isnâ€™t going to be aware of this API, as it is going to extend the Hasura API using remote schemas.
- Users are to be managed using some third party service (e.g. auth0)
- Authentication - based on jwt flow
- Cronjobs based actions and asynchronous operations are to be implemented using some serverless technology (e.g. AWS Lambda)
